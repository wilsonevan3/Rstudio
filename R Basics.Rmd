Basic Coding in R - maths
```{r}

#Basic Variable Storage, <- to input data to a variable name. 
x <- 3*4

y <- 5

#Can create data frames just like in pandas.
tmp_df <-data.frame(
  col_1 = c(1,2,3),
  col_2 = c("a","b","c")
)


#Functions
function_name(arg1, arg2, arg3)

seq(from, to, by,
    length.out, along.with)

seq(from = 10, to =100, by=10)


#Nesting Function
#    %>% means 'AND THEN'
#    Incredibly important across R and through tidy packages

do_something <- data %>%
  do_something() %>%
  do_another_thing()%>%
  do_last_thing()

#Tidyverse stuff
data %>%
  filter(year ==2018) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarize(mean=mean(income))

#something like that ^^^
