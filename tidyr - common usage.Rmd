The goal of tidyr is to help create tidy data that is efficient for data analysis
- Each variable is a column
- Each observation is a row
- Each Value is a cell

Make Data Taller and Make Wider - 2 main functions to do this....
- gather() - takes multiple columns and gathers them into key-value pairs:
              MAKES WIDE DATA LONGER

- spread() - takes two columns (key and value) and spreads into multiple columns
              MAKES LONG DATA WIDER 

Seperate and unite columns
- separate() - separate() - Seperate one column into multiple columns (deliniate)

- unite() - Unite multiple columns into one. 

For an example where there is data in the column headers...
```{r}
untidy_df %>%
  gather(gender_year, income, male_2016:female_2018) %>% #Columns you want to create, range:range select
  seperate(gender_year)





```
